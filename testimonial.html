                <p>  Digital upbringing of a child cannot be left to chance. The stakes are too high!. </p>
            
                      <p> Now adays more and more student interact with the digital content for learning so that the concept of the digital citizenship is becoming one of the most relevant instructional material used. 
                    As a teacher, it is our responsibility to authentically integrate digital citizenship into the curriculum in a positive way.On our 1st day we discussed about software and hardware and it's function inside and outside. The following saturday is all about spreadsheet and it is very helpful to us as a future deped teacher.Our recent topic is all about Web Development, it was hard yet we gained lot in creating web thru Html and CSS. 
                    </p>
